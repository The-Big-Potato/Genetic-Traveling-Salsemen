# Genetic-Traveling-Salsemen
This is a python console program used to solve the traveling salesman problem.

This program utilizes a genetic algorithim to generate potential paths between the cities.

These paths are randomly selected into pairs that generate offspring which make up the next generation.

This process continues for the specified number of generations and then returns the shortest path and its cost.
